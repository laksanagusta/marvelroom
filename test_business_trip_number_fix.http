### Expected Success Response
# The business trip should be created successfully now with a valid business_trip_number
# that fits within the VARCHAR(10) constraint.

# Business trip number formats:
# - Primary: BT-XXXX (e.g., BT-0001) - 10 characters exactly
# - Fallback: BT-XXXXXX (e.g., BT-a1b2c3) - 9 characters exactly (BT- + 6 chars UUID)

### Expected Business Trip Data Structure:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "business_trip_number": "BT-0001", // ✅ Fits VARCHAR(10) constraint
  "start_date": "2025-12-01",
  "end_date": "2025-12-05",
  "activity_purpose": "Client Meeting",
  "destination_city": "Jakarta",
  "assignees": [
    {
      "id": "assignee-uuid",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "spd_number": "SPD-002",
      "employee_id": "external-api-user-id", // ✅ Populated from external API
      "employee_name": "John Doe", // ✅ Populated from external API
      "employee_number": "1212313131121", // ✅ From request
      "position": "Tech Lead",
      "rank": "Senior",
      "transactions": [...]
    }
  ]
}

### Error Before Fix:
# "failed to create business trip: pq: value too long for type character varying(10)"
# This error occurred because business_trip_number was being generated as "BT-XXXXXXXXXX" (11 chars)

### Fix Applied:
# 1. Repository fallback logic reduced from 8 to 6 UUID characters
# 2. Generator UUID method reduced from 8 to 6 UUID characters
# 3. Both now generate 9-character numbers (BT-XXXXXX) that fit VARCHAR(10)
